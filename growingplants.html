        <h2 class="display-5 link-body-emphasis mb-1">Buying your first Plants</h2>

        <p>Buying your first plant is exciting as it is nerve racking, but do not let that dissuade you from experiencing the joys of owning a plant to maybe one day gardening. Luckily, most plants when bought from small or large retail stores will come with a plastic container as a pot that has some holes on the bottom. This is known as a “Nursery pot” and the holes on the bottom is to make sure that when you water the plant you do not accidentally drown it and it has a chance to escape from the bottom. Although you can also place this pot in a large bowl full of water so that the soil and plant can drink as much water as they can from those bottom holes and then you can remove it and place it in a dry area. You can absolutely leave the plant in this original pot and place it into a more decorative pot.</p>
        <p>You will know when it is ready to switch the plants from the original plastic pot to a new one once the roots start to grow out from the bottom of the drainage holes. Slowly remove some of the original soil into the new pot, yes you can reuse soil, and take your time removing the plant from the pot and place it in the middle of the new pot. Roots on all plants can experience a type of shock when they are being moved outside their soil. Loosen up most of the soil that is clinging to the roots and to avoid your plant from dying you can use a spray bottle of 3% hydrogen peroxide and to spray directly on the roots a couple times. This will help clean the roots from any kind of rot or mold. In the new pot make sure the bottom is covered in soil, even if it means adding some of your new soil to it, this includes some earth worm castings, aka their poop, or some coffee grounds. Once the roots on the plant is not wet with hydrogen peroxide you can now sprinkle a touch of rooting hormone, honey, or cinnamon to the roots and place it into the pot. Make sure there are plenty of soil to fill the pot to completely cover the roots but you do not want to pack it down. You only want to water it afterwards and that will help the soil to settle.</p>
      <h2>Nutrients</h2>
        <p>When buying your first or fiftieth plant the original soil that is comes with is generaly the correct soil for that plant loaded with nutrients and having the correct density to avoid overwatering and proper root growth. When watering your plant you must learn how much your plant actually need, such as cactuses and succulents need a lot of water but only need once a month watering while other flowers will only need to be watered once the soil is actually dry which can be once a week to every other week. If you feel like your plants are not growing as green or as much as your friends then you can add extra nutrients to your soils. Earlier I mentioned using coffee grounds and earth worm castings mixing it with your soil. Used coffee grounds and tea leaves have nitrogen, potassium, magnesium, calcium, as well as other smaller amounts of nutrients that can benefit the plant to growing stronger and healthier. </p>
        <p>I had also mentioned rooting hormones, honey, and cinnamon which can help the roots of plants grow stronger and thicker which help the plant absorb more of the nutrients from the soil and expand their roots out more. Other examples of over the counter nutrients that we consume that can help plants are water that had banana peels soaked over night in, oat water, and pasta water. These are some easier fertilizers you can make at home using some left over dinner trash you may usualy dumb down the sink.</p>

      <h3><a href="" class="nav-link">The Basics Easy To Remember</a></h3>
        <p>Caring for plants involves providing them with the right conditions, nutrients, and attention to help them thrive. Here are some general tips on how to care for plants:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Choose the Right Plant:</li>
              <ul>
              <li>Start by selecting plants that are suitable for your location, considering factors like light, temperature, and humidity levels.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Proper Pot or Soil:</li>
              <ul>
              <li>Use well-draining soil or potting mix designed for the specific type of plant you have. Ensure the container or pot has drainage holes.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Watering:</li>
              <ul>
              <li>Watering needs vary by plant type, so research the specific requirements of your plants.</li>
              <li>Generally, it's better to underwater than overwater. Allow the soil to dry slightly between watering, but don't let it become bone dry.</li>
              <li>Water thoroughly, ensuring that water reaches the root zone. Avoid getting water on the foliage to prevent diseases.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Light:</li>
              <ul>
              <li>Different plants have different light requirements. Some prefer direct sunlight, while others thrive in low-light conditions.</li>
              <li>Place your plants in an appropriate location based on their light preferences. Plants that need full light need to see the sky not sun.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Temperature and Humidity:</li>
              <ul>
              <li>Maintain the right temperature and humidity levels for your plants. Avoid extreme temperature fluctuations, drafts, and sudden temperature drops.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Fertilizing:</li>
              <ul>
              <li>Fertilize your plants with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season (usually spring and summer). Follow the recommended dosage on the fertilizer label.</li>
              <li>You can use also left over tea and coffee as long as there was not any sugar or creamers added.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Pruning and Deadheading:</li>
              <ul>
              <li>Regularly prune or deadhead (remove spent flowers) to encourage new growth and maintain the plant's shape.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Repotting:</li>
              <ul>
              <li>Repot your plants when they become root-bound or outgrow their containers. This is typically done every 1-2 years for most houseplants.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Pest and Disease Management:</li>
              <ul>
              <li>Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, mealybugs, and spider mites. If you notice any issues, treat them promptly with appropriate methods like neem oil or insecticidal soap.</li>
              <li>Remove any diseased or yellowing leaves to prevent the spread of diseases.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Support and Training:</li>
              <ul>
              <li>Provide support for tall or climbing plants with stakes, trellises, or cages.</li>
              <li>You can train vines or climbers to grow in a desired direction.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Rotate Plants:</li>
              <ul>
              <li>Rotate potted plants occasionally to ensure even growth and prevent them from leaning towards the light source.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Monitor and Observe:</li>
              <ul>
              <li>Regularly inspect your plants for signs of stress, such as wilting, yellowing leaves, or drooping. Adjust your care routine accordingly.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Patience:</li>
              <ul>
              <li>Remember that plants grow at their own pace. Be patient and give them time to flourish</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Learn and Research:</li>
              <ul>
              <li>Continuously educate yourself about the specific needs of your plants. Books, online resources, and plant care communities can be valuable sources of information.</li>
              </ul>
          </ol>
        <p>By following these general guidelines and tailoring them to the specific needs of your plants, you can create a healthy and thriving indoor or outdoor garden. Remember that each plant is unique, so it's essential to understand the individual requirements of the species you're caring for.</p>
